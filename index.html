<h5>Languages</h5>
<p>While Swedish is my mother tounge, I speak English fluently and I have a 
    Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English. I also studied Spanish for seven
    years and therefore understand and speak quite a bit. I also studied German
    for three years and took a course in Latin as well as studied Norwegian 
    recreationally.</p>

    <h6>Others</h6>
<p>In my spare time, I like to paint and read. Both with acrylics and oil on 
    canvas and digitally with my iPad. I have for example painted the livingroom
    paintings for a famous Swedish influencer, and designed the album cover and 
multiple collections of merchandise for the Swedish artist Theoz. I also have a drivers
license and a car. <br> Mail: selmapalmquist@hotmail.se Phone: 07 07 07 07 07</p>
